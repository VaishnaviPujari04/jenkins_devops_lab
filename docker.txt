# ⭐ **How to Build a Docker Image Using a Dockerfile (Complete Steps)**

Follow these steps exactly, and you will successfully build your own Docker image.

---

# **1️⃣ Install Docker (Only once)**

### On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

### On Windows/Mac:

Download **Docker Desktop**
👉 [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

---

# **2️⃣ Create a Project Folder**

Example:

```bash
mkdir travel-agency
cd travel-agency
```

---

# **3️⃣ Create Your Application Files**

Example (HTML/CSS):

```
index.html
styles.css
packages.html
```

---

# **4️⃣ Create a Dockerfile**

Inside your project folder, create a file named:

```
Dockerfile
```

### Example Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use official nginx web server image
FROM nginx:latest

# Copy all website files into nginx html directory
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
```

✔ This Dockerfile tells Docker to use NGINX and serve your website.

---

# **5️⃣ Build the Docker Image**

Run this command in the **same folder** where your Dockerfile is:

```bash
docker build -t travel-agency-site .
```

### What this command means:

* `docker build` → builds an image
* `-t travel-agency-site` → names the image
* `.` → build context (current folder)

---

# **6️⃣ Verify the Image Was Created**

Run:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see something like:

```
REPOSITORY            TAG       IMAGE ID       SIZE
travel-agency-site    latest    6ab23c1a5f78   150MB
```

✔ This confirms the image is successfully built.

---

# **7️⃣ Run the Image as a Container**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 travel-agency-site
```

* `-d` → run in background
* `-p 8080:80` → access website on localhost:8080
* `travel-agency-site` → image name

---

# **8️⃣ Test in Browser**

Open:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You should now see your website served from inside Docker! 🎉

---

# 🧠 **Complete Summary (Easy to remember)**

1. Create app files
2. Write Dockerfile
3. Use command:

   ```
   docker build -t imagename .
   ```
4. Run container:

   ```
   docker run -p 8080:80 imagename
   ```
5. Open browser → website visible
